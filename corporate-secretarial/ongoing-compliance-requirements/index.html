<p>This list of compliance requirements under the CA is meant as an introduction and not (nor intended to be) an exhaustive list of all of the requirements under the CA. The information contained herein has been vastly simplified and there are numerous other provisions in the CA (and other relevant legislations) not covered herein.</p>

<p>To ensure compliance with applicable laws, you should seek professional legal advice.</p>

<h2 id="first-meeting-of-the-board-of-directors">(1) First Meeting of the Board of Directors</h2>

<p>As soon as reasonably practicable following incorporation and preferably within 1 month of incorporation, the company directors should convene a first meeting of the board, noting and resolving certain matters, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the incorporation of the company;</li>
  <li>the first directors;</li>
  <li>the company secretary;</li>
  <li>the registered office;</li>
  <li>the common seal;</li>
  <li>the issue of share certificates to the initial shareholders; and</li>
  <li>setting the first financial period and the financial year end.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="company-common-seal">(2) Company Common Seal</h2>

<p>Every Singapore company should have a common seal, which should be adopted at the company’s first board meeting.</p>

<p>Under section 123 of the CA, the common seal is required to seal the share certificates, which must be issued (according to section 130(1) of the CA):</p>

<ul>
  <li>if it is an allotment, within 2 months of such allotment; or</li>
  <li>if it is a transfer, within 1 month of such transfer being lodged with the company.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="duplicate-common-seal">Duplicate Common Seal</h3>

<p>Under section 124 of the CA, a company may (if so authorised by its constitution) have a duplicate common seal which shall be a facsimile of the common seal of the company with the addition on its face of the words “Share Seal”.  A certificate under such duplicate seal is deemed to be sealed with the common seal of the company.</p>

<h2 id="memorandum-of-association">(3) Memorandum of Association</h2>

<p>Under section 22(4) of the CA, a copy of the company’s memorandum of association must be kept at the registered office of the company.</p>

<p>Such memorandum of association must be duly signed by the subscribers and state (if the company is to have a share capital) the number of shares that each subscriber has agreed to take.</p>

<h2 id="return-of-allotments">(4) Return of Allotments</h2>

<p>Under section 63 of the CA, whenever a company makes any allotment of shares (other than a deemed allotment), the company must lodge within 14 days lodge with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“<strong>ACRA</strong>”) a return of the allotments stating:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of shares comprised in the allotment;</li>
  <li>the amount (if any) paid or deemed to be paid on the allotment of each share;</li>
  <li>the amount (if any) unpaid on the allotment of each share;</li>
  <li>if the company has different share classes, the class of shares to which each share comprised in the allotment belongs; and</li>
  <li>for each of the shareholders (or if the company will have more than 50 shareholders after such allotment, for each of the 50 shareholders who following the allotment will hold the most number of shares in the company (excluding treasury shares)):
    <ul>
      <li>the full name;</li>
      <li>identification;</li>
      <li>nationality;</li>
      <li>address; and</li>
      <li>the number and class of shares held.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="definition-of-identification">Definition of “identification”</h3>

<p>Under section 63(4) of the CA, “identification” means, in the case of a person issued with an identity card, the number of his identity card and, in the case of a person not issued with an identity card, particulars of his passport or such other similar evidence of identification as is available.</p>

<h2 id="notice-of-alteration-in-share-capital">(5) Notice of Alteration in Share Capital</h2>

<p>Under section 71 of the CA, where any of the following alteration of share capital has taken place, a company may lodge with ACRA a notice of the same in the prescribed form:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital;</li>
  <li>convert all or any of its paid-up shares into stock and reconvert that stock into paid-up shares;</li>
  <li>subdivide its shares or any of them, so however that in the subdivision the proportion between the amount paid and the amount (if any) unpaid on each reduced share must be the same as it was in the case of the share from which the reduced share is derived;</li>
  <li>cancel the number of shares which at the date of the passing of the resolution in that behalf have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person or which have been forfeited and diminish the amount of its share capital by the number of the shares so cancelled.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="timeframe-for-filing">Timeframe for Filing</h3>

<p>Although no time frame is set for the filing of the notice of alteration in share capital, it must be lodged before the annual return is filed.</p>

<h2 id="notice-of-transfer-of-shares">(6) Notice of Transfer of Shares</h2>

<p>Under section 128A of the CA, where there has been a transfer of shares, a company may lodge with ACRA a notice of such transfer in the prescribed form.</p>

<p>The notice must state:</p>

<ul>
  <li>every other transfer of shares effected prior to the date of the notice (other than a transfer that has been previously notified to ACRA); or</li>
  <li>if the company has more than 50 members after the transfer, the prescribed information in relation to the shares held by each of the 50 members who hold the most number of shares in the company after the transfer.</li>
</ul>
